Coming up soon ...

<!--
1. Formed datasets of the variation of CPU load through automatically performing operations on several major applications by using adb shell;
2. Trained and compared two time series model: TCN and LSTM to predict CPU load and achieve 95% accuracy;
3. Realized the forward propagation process of TCN models in C++ language, integrated the model into test app on Android through the Java Native, and optimized the memory usage.
