1. Replaced attention mechanisms with memory-efficient operators like Orchid or Hyena to handle contexts longer than 160k tokens in sequence modeling such as DNA Analysis;
2. Pretrained models on human reference genome datasets and then the fine tuned model reacher over 95% accuracy on Genomic-Benchmarks and Species Classification Tasks;
