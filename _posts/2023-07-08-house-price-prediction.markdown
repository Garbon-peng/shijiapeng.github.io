<!--
The project first preprocessed data with transformations, missing data handling, and smoothing. Then it applied GAM, Random Forest, and Boosting, optimizing parameters and validating performance.

The project applies GAM, Random Forest, and Boosting to predict house prices. The models are optimized and validated to achieve the best performance. The results show that Boosting has the lowest error, while Smoothing and Random Forest offer trade-offs.
